The form includes a "Select Pick Up" field using the LocationPicker component. When the user selects a pick-up location, it will be stored in the pickup state. The user can also select the destination, and when the form is submitted, the distance between the pick-up and destination will be calculated using the Google Maps Distance Matrix API, and the transport fare will be displayed.
the Dashboard page(you should see Google Maps displayed in the Select Pickup Location and Select Destination fields, and you can pick locations directly on the map. The transport fare will be calculated based on the distance between the pickup and destination using the Google Maps Distance Matrix API. .)

## app.jsx 
the  application's routing using the react-router-dom library. It defines routes for your different components: LoginForm, SignUpForm, Dashboard, Profile, and Logout. The Sidebar component is also rendered within the main container, assuming it provides navigation links.

## (manually calculate the transport fare using the distance between pickup and destination, and a fare per kilometer value. )
In this code, I've added a constant farePerKm which represents the fare per kilometer. You can adjust this value according to your pricing structure. The calculateDistanceAndFare function calculates the transport fare by multiplying the distance by the farePerKm value. The result is then displayed in the input field for the fare.
Transport fare = Distance * Fare per km (The formula)
Where: Distance: The distance between the pickup and destination locations.
Fare per km: The cost of one kilometer of travel.
## index.html 
The HTML code you have provided is for a simple React application that uses the Google Maps Places API. The code includes a script tag that loads the Google Maps Places script and defines a global callback function called initMap(). The initMap() function is triggered when the Google Maps Places script is loaded. The initMap() function then renders the React components in the /src/main.jsx file.
